# Teamwork

This month has been a hell of a ride. Physically and emotionally. I hope it doesn't sound as a complaint, 'cause it isn't. I'm just being honest, taking in account my feelings and fatigue.

Hell of a ride, yes, but certainly full of learnings. That's why I think it was totally worth it.

I told you a couple of my learnings regarding teamwork in the _Untitled_ post, but I can keep going.

The "goal" overall in this phase was to develop a project, working with a real client, having daily stand ups and weekly demos and so on, until the final deliverable (I say "goal" because of course, there more things involved, like having agile practices, writing code applying good practices and using devops tools).

The thing is, we failed. Since the beginning. And we never recovered, although the rest of the team would tell us to change our behaviour and reconsider the way we were working. We made a looot of mistakes, and at the end, we didn't get to deliver the project as we expected and promised, but the actual problem wasn't not finishing the project.

We were expected to fail, yes, but also to learn quick from it and change the strategy. We were supposed to fail because of being ambitious, not because of a bad organization and an awful communication.

## Problems within the dev team <a href="#devs" id="devs"></a>

Internally, we struggled trying to keep track on what was everyone doing, and we would often find ourselves short of time, so we wouldn't check the code of our partners, which is definitely not a good practice.&#x20;

At the beginning, we took a long time discussing and taking decisions, at advanced at a slow pace. At the end none of that was important, because as we kept coding and coding, we would often find out there were more and more details that we didn't take into account.

Then we focused on coding only, forgetting to let the others know what we were doing and reaching out for help.

Also, we wouldn't take the time to stop, let's say, once a week, and reflect on our work, how we were doing things, what was right and what was wrong. That way, we could have changed things sooner.

## Problems with the rest of the team <a href="#whole_team" id="whole_team"></a>

Week after week, we repeated the mistake of telling the rest of the team that we were having trouble right before our demos, instead of having constant communication and letting them know throughout the week how we were doing.

Thinking of it, I also realize that, we were often trying to write like, the perfect message, _how can we make it sound right or better?_ We would try to agree on what should be said and how it should it be said before any of us sent a message in the channel.

After this month, I realized that just being completely honest and raising the hand on time would have made the message (and the whole communication) a thousand times better.

Yes, of course there would have been probably another details to fix ( e. g., being too technical, to assume that everybody would understand what we were saying, speaking as if we were giving orders instead of asking for favors, that kind of stuff), but once the communication begins, help can be provided.

**For me, that was the main problem. Trying to solve everything by ourselves.**

Trying to make everything perfect, because "we said we would do this and we have to get it done no matter what".

We didn't ask for anyone's help in general. I tried to be close to my mentors, but I could have talked to them more often, and I actually didn't talk to them about how we were working until the very end. None of us asked for code reviews either. We made pair programming with each other, but never with an expert.

Oh, also, we tried so hard to fit everything, to reach the goal, that we didn't leave enough time to properly prepare our presentations, to think of a logical way to show the progress and give enough context for everyone, so we all knew what was going on.



Overall, it was a failure. Not the worst maybe, but a big one. We didn't reach our full potential. I hope I never go through this again. I mean, I'm probably going to fail a lot later in my career, but I don't want to repeat the same mistake. I'm definitely willing to be more open. Reach out for help and let the others help me. I don't have to do everything perfect in the first try or on my own. Just one step at a time.
