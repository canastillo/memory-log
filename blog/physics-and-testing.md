# Physics and testing

I cannot believe it's been just a week since last time. It was sooo much information. So yep, I learned a lot of things, there are even topics which I'll have to read more about. Anyway, this is this week's essay.

### Quantum physics and time traveling

It's so interesting this phenomenon of the world and science working different on a super small scale. I watched a couple of videos about quantic computers. Now I have a better understanding of how regular computers work and had no idea that transistors were so small (14 nanometers!).&#x20;

About quantum physics itself, well, I'm obviously not becoming an expert in the field within a week. Feynman himself said that **if you think you understand quantum physics, you don't actually understand quantum physics**. Anyway, I like it how just thinking of it takes me to question everything I see or am. I'm reminded of questioning my reality.

Now, about time traveling. I love sci-fi movies, specially when involving time traveling. So, while reading about how Git works, I could not stop myself from thinking "it's just like time traveling". I mean, you cannot change commits:

> “edits” to the commit history are actually creating entirely new commits, and references are updated to point to the new ones

It just made me think of that Avenger's Endgame scene where Hulk and Nebula explain to Scott and War Machine that you cannot just change the past.

Now it's clearer to me how Git works. Commits are nothing but snapshots, which aim to their parents (not their children!), and it's all about references! Realizing this allows me to better understand what happens when I'm introducing Git commands in the terminal. Also, after reading the theory (and having actual practice), I'm now able to see how cool is the staging area.

### "Please don't you break" a.k.a. Testing <a href="#testing" id="testing"></a>

I think this was my favorite part of everything I learned. Reading about the unit testing and test-driven development from someone who was there when these topics started to spread is priceless.&#x20;

I learned how there's testing based on state and testing based on behaviour (I have to investigate if there's something that combines both), and how the teams get to decide what a _Unit_ is; they are the ones who know what makes sense to be called a unit.&#x20;

All these concepts are new to me. There are holes I yet have to fill. There are parts of the story I don't fully get. In spite of (or due to?) this, I want to learn how to integrate testing in my work, on frontend web development specially, in order to make a quality job. I'm also looking forward to reading some of Kent Beck's works.

### When I suffer the most is when I learn the most <a href="#java" id="java"></a>

I don't like Java. I usually have bad experiences while using it. However, I honestly think I don't like it because I have never had the chance to really get to know it. Also, the more I learn about software development, the more I discover how important and relevant has Java been. So, I had been wanting to play with it for a couple of months now, and the opportunity came. Hell I suffered, but hell I liked it.

![Did you know Java Evil Edition is actually regular Java?](../.gitbook/assets/R.png)

The task was to make a User-Based Recommender using Mahout. To be honest, I underestimated the challenge. The hard part wasn't the recommendation thing (Mahout got us covered), but the processing-the-data part.

I learned a lot about Java syntax, regex, and creating CSVs with it. Having so many classes and options to do the same thing confuses me a lot, but I'm pretty sure I will eventually get it. I'm interested in learning about the JVM, data types, classes and interfaces. I still got a lot of questions about Java.

Anyway, one thing I got to know a little about is Java build tools for dependency management. I mean, I didn't know Maven and Gradle were two types of the same thing, and I didn't even know they both were for dependency management. However, dependency management is important, so I'm willing to deeply understand Maven first and then Gradle.

### Imagination for innovation

I had never heard of the concept _Moonshot thinking_. It's basically about having a clear goal or problem to solve, and come up with radical ideas for solving it.

I see these guys at Google X doing research and small prototypes, and they don't care about if it is going to work, but to fail fast and learn a lot from it.

> I’m not, and I assure you, you are not smart enough to figure out ahead of time which of the hundred things you are gonna try is the one that’s gonna work out. \[…] unless you are the Steve Jobs of this generation, the right answer is: try stuff!

&#x20;   \-Astro Teller

The point is daring to take big risks.

The truth is, I'm not sure if I can do that kind of stuff. Anyway, I feel more attracted to Bret Victor' idea of _Inventing on Principle._ How we should do things because it makes sense to us. Creators need immediate connection to what they are creating. Maybe it's something only the creator see, but that's okay.

The point is finding our mission.

I think this idea is related to Moonshot thinking actually.

Speking of the moon, I just want to finish the blog sharing with you how happy I felt after listening Carl Sagan's reflection on _Pale Blue Dot._ It is related to the message I wanted to give at the end of my first Lighting Talk, but well done. The thing is, our problems often seem so big (and some truly are!), we tend to forget we are nothing but dust in the wind, or well, a pale blue dot in space. How important it is to remember we are nothing compared with the cosmos, so we can learn to be kind with others.
