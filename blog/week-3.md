# Who do you trust?

I liked a lot the topics of this week. I already knew that software engineering is more about dealing with people rather than dealing with computers, but now I see that I actually hadn't lived it in my own flesh.

It was a good week for learning about teamwork.

### There's no actual best language

It all started with he assignment that we had to do as a team. We were given four challenges that we had to solve in five different languages. The way we organized maybe it wasn't the best, and we certainly got a lot to improve about it, but it was our first time collaborating in this way. _It doesn't have to be perfect_. We just needed to get things done.

I chose Haskell 'cause I had heard it's hard, and I wanted to have fun. I learned a looot about it and about functional programming:

* Variables are inmutable (they are not _variables_, they are labels to values)
* Haskell uses lazy evaluation: expressions are not evaluated unless required (this is cool for the CPU but not for the RAM)
* There are no loops (you use recursivity!)

I also helped developing the Ruby solution for one of the problems, so I learned a little about Ruby too, yet not as much as with Haskell.

This helped me to reinforce this idea that I have been hearing long ago: _languages are just tools_. This was one of the main points during this week: how us programmers need to be polyglot.

Why? 'Cause depending on the task at hand, the constraints of the problem, and other criteria like productivity, performance and portability, we will need to choose one language or the other. That is, _there's no perfect language_. There are just different circumstances. We have to learn to get rid of favoritism and prejudice.

### Code is written by people, not by tools

Speaking of prejudice, the other main point to learn this week was the one I mentioned at the beginning: _software engineering is more about dealing with people than dealing with computers_.

The thing is, we are hardwired for setting labels, based on stereotypes, for classifying people. This is difficult to change, but being aware helps a lot. Most of the time, once we set a role for someone, this someone will behave that way. _We're creating reality by setting expectations_.

These stereotypes also have influence in our own behaviour. We could think someone is dangerous or a bad person only 'cause we don't know them and tend to think the worse. But this doesn't have to be that way.

There have been experiments where a group of people hates another group of people just because of prejudice, and then everybody become friends after facing together a problem that affected everyone. It isn't even about liking each other, just about **trust and respect**.

I feel like, that's kinda what has been happening in my batch. The ones who care, we have been dealing with these challenges together, and that is slowly turning us into a team.

It is also important to remember that we cannot treat everyone as the same. I mean, we should not expect enlightening answers from a novice or treating an expert like a beginner. Each one of us is at their own stage.

In conclusion, we not only have to learn to work with any language, but with any people.
