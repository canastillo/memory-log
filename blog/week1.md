# Ubuntu

## It's been a weird week

In the lectures of this week, I kinda noticed there were three _personal levels_ (I don't know how else to call them) in which we were fed: technical stuff, self-management, and community awareness.

I was jumping from topic to topic and, although most of them were related, it felt super weird watching a video about religion and self-trascendence after spending an hour or so reading about how to use the shell.

Anyway, here is what I've been learning this week.

### Technical stuff

I had the chance to review the concept of queues and stacks with an exercise in HackerRank, in which I used Javascript.

At the beginning I didn't know how to tackle it 'cause I had to write a function that was going to be treated as a class (well, an instance of a class, with its methods and all), so I searched for an example, and found out I could just use the `this` keyword to add my functions. I'm not sure of why it was okay to use `this` so I'll have to do a research.

I was also reminded of the built-in function `shift` and how it is different from `pop`.

In the lecture about the shell I could review the basics on how to use it and now I just have to search what's difference between `cat file.txt` and `cat < file.txt`

{% hint style="info" %}
**Reminder:** The concepts _shell_, _terminal_ and _prompt_ are often used as synonyms but aren't actually the same. Gotta investigate about it again.
{% endhint %}

Btw, here's my HackerRack profile: [canastillo](https://www.hackerrank.com/canastillo\_)

### Self-management and habits <a href="#management" id="management"></a>

* I learned a lot about how an idea it's worth nothing until it is real. It's all in the execution.
* I also think I'm kind of a _Pacer_ when it comes to _autopilot habits._
* The thought of being frustrated doesn't seem too bad if that helps me to break my limits.
* It's not all about sensorial perception.&#x20;
* I have actually always liked the idea of letting my brain find the underlying deep patterns that hide from me. Now I know these can help create my own mental representations.

### Community awareness

I'm not sure of what _Ubuntu_ exactly means. I just know that I will never forget the idea that I made part of me when reading that post on Facebook trying to explain that word:

> **I am because we are. We are because I am.**

The idea of seeing me in everyone else and seeing everyone else in me has haunted me for a long time now. I cannot explain why, but the more I looked outside, to the people, the more I could find myself, and viceversa. That's why it made me so happy hearing Jonathan Haidt talking about Durkheim's _Homo DÃºplex,_ and reading John __ Ousterhout's lecture on how we have to take care of the little details in relationships regards.

I know how important is to see me as part of the community and to see the community as part of me. Now I just gotta change my passive and unconscious autopilot habits and try some of the Leil Lowndes' tips.
