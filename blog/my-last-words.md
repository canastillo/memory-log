# My last words (?

This was a pretty good week.

After the three-week training, we were given one week to complete a task. It was a to-do app where users could add, delete and update to-dos. Also a search feature was included; this search could be by name, state or priority. We had to add a sorting and filtering capability too, and an average completion time dashboard.

It was pretty interesting. I've always seen the to-do apps suggested as a beginner-friendly project for people starting on web developing, so it was always kinda simple. This one included a lot of features and was really fun to develop. You got no idea how I enjoyed building it.

The first day dealing with the backend was a little too much for me, but after that first barrier, I realized that I had understood more than I thought about spring boot. Every step I took was becoming slowly more and more logic and obvious. I struggled a lot with testing the controllers tho, and wasted a lot of time on that.

Anyway, I made some mistakes which didn't allow me to successfully finish the app:

* Wasted way too much time on one thing: trying to test my controllers. We were not allowed to make pairing, so, if I couldn't make it in 1 - 2 hours, it was time to leave it. But nop, I didn't. This cost me like, half a day of work.
* I thought I had made a good job discerning the priorities of each small task, but now I think I could have done better. I thought the average calculations were more important for the "client" rather than the search, filtering, and sorting, but because of this I jumped the step of building the feature for creating, deleting and updating to-dos, which is actually basic for all the other tasks.
* For me, I think I would have been a better idea to spend, maybe half a day in the backend and half a day in the frontend, instead of two days on one thing and another two days on the other one. Yet, I think the backend demanded more of my time actually.

That's for the "software developing" part. Now, about the technical part, I learned:

* Adding all the changed files except for one to a commit.
* Finally understood commit ammend!
* Differences between DTOs, Repositories and DAOs (among other things, repositories and DAOs are patterns for accessing data, while DTOs are for transporting data. Repositories may be implemented with the help of DAOs, but DAOs cannot implement Repositories).
* How to use the Optional and ResponseEntity classes.
* How and when to use RequestParam, PathParam and RequestBody.
* Using environmental variables in Vite.
* We can send components with props as props.

Finally, well, this week I was extended an offer for a full-time position as Java Engineer Jr. so, yeah, thank you all. This is the result of team work, I'm sure. I still got a looooot of things to learn, but I know I'm gonna enjoy it a lot.

I'm so excited for what's coming, hope u r all there to see it.
