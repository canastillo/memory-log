# I'm remarkable

I watched a video about this _anti-fragile_ concept. I think we learned a little about it some weeks ago on an interview to a Netflix engineer. Anyway, I didn't have the chance to notice how interesting this concept is.

Fragile things break after some pressure, robust things resist, but anti-fragile improves. We gain from disorder. Just like this PEAK concept that explains how when we are pushed out off our limits, when we feel uncomfortable, that's when we grow. Just like muscles!

Being anti-fragile explains why routine and monotony may be damaging to us.

From this new point of view, mistakes even seem cool. It's that chaos which makes us look for order. Again, it's not about failing, but recovering from it. The sooner the better, but everyone have their own pace.



Today I attended a workshop. It was called "I'm remarkable". It was cool. It helped to learn about myself and my emotions. From now on, I'm gonna pay more attention on which moments I can give my opinion and show my knowledge. It's not bragging if it's based on facts.

From this talk, the part that most impacted me was

> My narrative.
>
> Who is telling my story?
>
> Do I want to tell it myself?



I also have been learning about demos with my team. We are struggling in showing a good presentation ('cause we don't get the time to practice before and plan how we want to show everything) and in the communication with the whole team, and with the client. I mean, this part of communicating what we did, what we couldn't do, what we still have to do and how to negotiate.

It's a process. The thing is recognizing mistakes and asking how to improve.

It's a shame this phase only lasts one month. It ends in one week. Yet, I feel so tired, that I'm so happy that it is almost over.

Bittersweet taste.
