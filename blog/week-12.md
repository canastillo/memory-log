# Untitled

This week has been full of learnings about teamwork, communication, expectations, and about myself, but I'd rather leave that for the essay about the whole phase. Anyway, here are my learnings on other topics I read or heard about, and how I think they relate to the experiences we lived through this phase.

## Interesting topics

> The expectations we have of the world change the way we see it.&#x20;

Optimism bias may be beneficial but also disadvantageous. In general, it moves us to reach our goals, and the people expecting good things of the future are happier, but it often prevents us from seeing the truth as it is.

I think that kinda happened in my team. Like, we had expectations on finishing the whole project, and that wouldn't allow us to reflect and change the strategy periodically nor to truly prioritize the tasks.

In a conference about medicine, I heard that in the past doctors were perceived as an autonomous person who had to know everything. This idea of the doctors is often kept the same as of today, which doesn't allow medicine to improve. There's plenty of technology and knowledge, but as long as doctors don't learn to work together as a team, there's not much they can do for people.

Again, I think this happened to us. I see as a rope. There are two ends. One were we try to solve everything by ourselves, and the other one where we want the others to solve everything for us. Teamwork is right in the middle. We have to do our tasks, but we don't have to do it alone.

The communication from my team (the devs) with the rest of the team was deficient. We wouldn't let the others know we were struggling until it was too late. We behaved as the doctors who would try to solve everything by themselves. We are willing to change that.

## Technical stuff

During the whole phase I learned a loooot about React and Spring Boot. About routing, the structure of a project, how to keep a theme throughout the system. We have received some code review and I haven't had the chance to fully read it but I'm sure I'm gonna learn a lot about it too.

The one thing that I learned and found really really really useful is this concept of git squash. For me, it makes a lot of sense wanting to keep a lot of commits together, specially when merging a branch into another. I've tried that my teammates use it too but haven't had any success on that.
