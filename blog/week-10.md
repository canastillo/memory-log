# If you want to go far...

During this week, I think my learnings were more focused on teamwork. I certainly learned a couple of things about Git and React after some pair programming with my teammates, but overall, I think we have been learning about how each one of us work, how to use our knowledge and strengths, and how to help with each other's weaknesses.

### Our bad

We have tried different stuff and keep trying to improve our strategy.

Among the mistakes we have been making, we fortunately have discovered:

* We were not being agile. This one was obvious but we had to find why.
* We would spend most of our time discussing and planning rather than executing.
* We waited for everyone's approval before making a decision.
* We would make decisions during calls instead of having an asynchronous conversation through the slack channel.
* We changed the topic of the conversation before getting to a conclusion, so we had to go back to a previous topic.
* Everyone wanted to talk at the same time.
* We made decisions and come up with questions, yes, but nobody took notes (that all the others could read later), so there was no record of what was being decided.

After realizing this, we made some adjustments to our plan:

* Discuss stuff through the slack channel. Don't wait until meetings.
* One person takes notes (I mean, everyone is free of taking their own notes, but one has to make them available for the others. This occurs through Notion).
* Added time boxes to our meetings. Ideal: 30 mins. Max: 1 hour.
* One person moderates the meetings. Each day a different person gets this role. This person checks if someone is taking too long and makes sure that all important topics are discussed.
* Don't change the topic until there is nothing else to say about the current one.
* Use the "raise hand" feature for having more organized discussions.
* Divide tasks. Not everyone has to solve everything. The same goes for not-so-vital decisions.

The results of this week will prove us if these adjustments are enough and what other things we should try to fix.

### ... go together

For me, this week has been full of reflections.

We are all trying to do our best, yet we make some mistakes. Maybe while programming or trying to integrate something, sometimes while trying to say or express an idea, or maybe in the way we communicate with the client. Anyway, it is really cool knowing that I can count on my team, and that I'm in a place where I can receive feedback.

I just can't believe how confortable I feel with my team. Like, at the beginning I wasn't sure if they were "as committed as me". I'm really sorry. I feel ashamed of how arrogant that might sound, but honestly, that's the way I usually feel. Now, after reflecting on my performance and my teammates efforts, I see that I tend to have way too high expectations. Of my teammates and of myself, which has often lead me to lose patience.

I'm not perfect, and no one is. And that's completely fine. I'm learning to be more chill about that.

Truth is I have an awesome team. Every day I learn new things from and about them. I'm so happy I'm not alone dealing with this project; they got my back and I got theirs. That's all for this week, see ya!
