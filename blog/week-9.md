# Real People

I don't even know where to start.

We have begun a new phase. Now we're dealing with clients, planning, and negotiation. The kind of stuff you are not taught at school.

During this week, I feel like, I haven't been exposed to a lot of technical knowledge, but whole new experiences and plenty of emotions.

Pretty weird to be honest. But that's fine. Funny how when I think I couldn't be more uncomfortable, this program keeps surprising me more and more.

I'm sorry, but today I don't feel like talking 'bout git, mac problems, optimism bias nor medicine (topics in which I dived a little this week). Next time I may include them, but for now, let me talk about all the other things that are crossing my mind.

### About this week

Each time I sit to write my essay, I begin thinking "this has been a strange week", and this one is not the exception.

As I mentioned earlier, we begun a new phase, which is about developing a project that meets the requirements of a client. I was assigned to a team that will work on a project for Encora itself.

It's been a mess.

Kinda.

Let's say my team and I are working nice together, pretty cool dynamic we have developed. They are nice guys, and I enjoy working with them.

But. There's always a "but".

We just haven't been focusing on the right stuff. We have been wasting a lot of time planning and talking, instead of actually **doing things**. Spent a lot of time&#x20;

After some meetings, we managed to identify two problems:

* We haven't finished discussing some topic and then we jump into another one
* It's hard to remember what was agreed if we don't take any notes

### About Ana Castillo

What? That joke is not funny anymore? Be thankful I didn't choose it as the main title.
